# Stock App
A webapp which allows the user to manage stock, intended for small start-up businesses

## A Breif Overview
This app will allow the user to:
- Create and manage parts/stock
- Build stock take sheets
- Create stock level reports
- Store supplier's information
- Record outbound orders against suppliers
- Export data for backups
- Provide customization settings (Accent colour, text sizes...)

## Tech Stack
I intend to use **Angular 16** for the entire project. This means no backend to store/distribute the user's data enabling this app to be hosted on a static webpage for minimal running costs.
Required knowledge:
- Angular Framework
- Typescript
- RXJS
- HTML
- CSS
- Figma

## Dev Progression
### First Task
1. Create a rough design, colour pallet and general UX flow using **Figma**
   - General theme established
   - Parts page layout complete
3. Design database layout (NoSQL)
4. Begin Angular project
   - Implement required modules (**Ng-Bootstrap**, **localForage**)
   - Create database services to interface with **locaForage** and setup db environment
   - Build a basic (no style) test page to check database is working correctly
5. Deploy Basic app to **Github Pages**
